## 2024
All the code for this year's will be done in Golang.
I chose Golang because I wanted to refresh my memory of Golang and get more familiar with using it.

1) Part 1:
- given two arrays of equal length separated by spaces in input text file
- sort them ascending
- pair numbers from arrays
- find absolute difference of each pair of numbers and sum them up and return this sum

2) Part 2:
- count the number of times a number from the first array appears in the second array
- multiply the number and its frequency and do this for each number in the first array and sum these up and return this sum
